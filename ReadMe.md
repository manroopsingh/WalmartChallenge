Please review "ASDA_Android_Assesment.pdf" file in project directory for instructions.

As you may know, Facebook does not give access to full friends list anymore but only friends who have downloaded the app. So for the purpose of this application I have created some test users. Please test the application using the following credentials as using your's will return an empty list.

**Username: bill_syjzlaz_gates@tfbnw.net**  
**Password: bill12345**

Because these are test users their profiles are not so rich in content.

Although, you can get the whole friend's list using **Taggable Friends API** and **Inviting Friends API** but they need review approval from Facebook Review Team or prerequisite for a game app and Facebook Desktop.
